## Unlike in Java, Ruby...

- Everything is an object, including numbers as *1* or *3.14159* 
- No casting 
- You do *foo = Foo.new "hola"* instead of *Foo foo = new Foo("hola")*
- The constructor method is always called *initialize*
- *mixins* instead of *interfaces*
- *YAML* instead of *XML*
- *nil* instead of *null*
