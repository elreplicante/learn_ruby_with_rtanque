## Unlike in Java, Ruby...

- The code is not compiled, just executed 
- Use *end* instead of curly braces 
- Use *require* instead of *import* 
- All instance variables are private, you access them via methods 
- You don't need parenthesis on method calls 
- Everything is an object, including numbers as *1* or *3.14159* 
- There's no data declaration, just assign values to variable names *a = [1, 2, 3]* instead of *int[] a = [1, 2, 3]*
